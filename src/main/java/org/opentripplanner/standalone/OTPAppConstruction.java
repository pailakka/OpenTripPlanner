/**
 * This class is responsible for creating the top level services like {@link OTPConfiguration},

 * application, creating the necessary Services and modules and putting them together.
 * It is NOT responsible for starting or running the application. The hole idea of this
 * class is to separate application construction from running it.
 * <p/>
 * The top level construction class(this class) may delegate to other construction classes to
 * inject configuration and services into sub-modules.
 * <p/>
 * THIS CLASS IS NOT THREAD SAFE - THE APPLICATION SHOULD BE CREATED IN ONE THREAD. This
 * should be really fast, since the only IO operations are reading config files and logging.
 * Loading transit or map data should NOT happen during this phase.
